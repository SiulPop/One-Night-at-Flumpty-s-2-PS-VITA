# One-Night-at-Flumpty-s-2-PS-VITA
"Welcome one and all to Flumpty Bumpty's, If the light's turned off then you're safe, If the lights are on then they'll come find you, And rip you a brand new face."

Once again Flumpty Bumpty and his assortment of awesome friends have invited you (kidnapped) to a special place to play a game! All you need to do is avoid them untill it's 6am and they will become your brand new best friends. If you the get to you before 6am well... best not think about it.

This new and exciting place is full of different set of rules you will need to learn quick and your only tools available include a light switch computer running with an old battery and a couple of vents.

Good luck and hope you make some great life long friends...
